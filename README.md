# Object-Detection-Using-SSD
Perform Object Detection using SSD (Single Shot Detection) in the simplest way possible

SSD is designed for object detection in real-time. Faster R-CNN uses a region proposal network to create boundary boxes and utilizes those boxes to classify objects. While it is considered the start-of-the-art in accuracy, the whole process runs at 7 frames per second. Far below what real-time processing needs. SSD speeds up the process by eliminating the need for the region proposal network. To recover the drop in accuracy, SSD applies a few improvements including multi-scale features and default boxes. These improvements allow SSD to match the Faster R-CNNâ€™s accuracy using lower resolution images, which further pushes the speed higher. According to the following comparison, it achieves the real-time processing speed and even beats the accuracy of the Faster R-CNN. (Accuracy is measured as the mean average precision mAP: the precision of the predictions.)

The SSD object detection composes of 2 parts:

-Extract feature maps, and
-Apply convolution filters to detect objects.
